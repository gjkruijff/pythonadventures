\chapter*{Introduction to Part 1} 

Let's get started! In this part we are going to cover quite some ground ... We start right away with building a simple, text-based adventure. Hello adventure world! We then continue with learning how we can let the player make decisions (i.e. actually play the game!), and how we can keep track of what all is happening. Towards the end of this first part, we build things out to a fully-fledged game engine that can run "any" kind of text adventure. 

Specifically, you will learn: 
\begin{itemize}
\item How to use \textit{Atom}, \texttt{git}, to edit, run, and version your programs
\item How to let your program show something in a Terminal (\texttt{print}), and get some input from your user (\texttt{input})  
\item How to implement basic control structures in Python, for decisions (\texttt{if..then..else}) and loops (\texttt{while...} loops, and \texttt{for} enumerations) 
\item How to define functions, classes, and modules in Python (and what these things are! and why they are useful!)  
\item How to store your adventures as files, using a structured file format (\textit{JSON})
\item How to save games, and load them, and how to load game resources 
\end{itemize}
